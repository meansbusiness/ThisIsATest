\f0\fs24 \cf0 Part  1a\
\
1. The function of the path and class path environmental variables is to be accessible by all paths for a test program \
\
2. The statement is not valid because you are taking the double syntax and setting it equal to the value of 1, it should be set to 1.0 or a non whole number.\
\
3. The statement is not valid because a int value needs to be a whole number and it is set to 1.0.\
\
4. The value of b would be false \
\
5. if replaced the value of b would be true\
\
6. long should be used on a 64 bit output\
\
7.The result would be a double because the double type is dominant.\
\
8. A while loop should be used when evaluating multiple statements.\
\
Part 1b\
\
9. The program consist of a public class called Demo,  The first output for the first parameters would output be x1 add the value by 1, x2 would add by 2, x3 become array of zero.\
\
The second output would have the variable x increment by x.\
\
The third output would would have x decrement by x\
\
The fourth output would have the array be set equal to zero.\
