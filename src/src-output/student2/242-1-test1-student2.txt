1. The PATH function sets the location for where the files and classes are running from 
   The CLASSPATH function is what calls the class files you created and where they are being called from

2. double x= 1; is a valid statement because a double can either be a whole number, such as 1, or it can have a floating point decimal, such as 1.0.
	
3. int a= 1.0; is not a valid statement because an int is only a single valued number with no decimal.
	
4. The value will be true and the value of y will be 2

5. The value will be true

6. You should use long instead of int when you are dealing with more complex numbers such as pi and don't want to loose precision or rounding errors. 

7. The result will be a double. Which makes sense because 

8. You should use a while loop/ do- while loop when you have a boolean  that  can be tested to see if you want to continue to iterate the block of code. Whereas for-loops are useful when you know the number of iterations you want to perform before you start the loop

9. System.out.println("In main: x1 = " + x1); will print out 2, because it is incrementing(adding) the number by one
   System.out.println("In main: x2 = " + x2); will print out 2, because it is decrementing (subtracting) the number by two
   System.out.println("In main: x3[0], x3[1] = " + x3[0] + ", " + x3[1]); will print out 1, because it is taking the value of the indicated index and adding them together.
