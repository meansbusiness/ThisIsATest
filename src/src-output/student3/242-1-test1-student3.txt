1. They function to get to your files and in order to compile and run programs
2. Yes because it will automatically save it as 1.0

4. true. y would be 2
5. It would come out as true also.
6. You use long instead of int when you need a huge range of values wider than provided by int
7. The result would be a double or should be a double. This makes sense because if it was an int
	we could loose precision.
8. You would use a while or do-while loop instead of a for loop if you do not know the exact number of times 
	you would want to loop.
9.  In increment: x = 2
	In main: x1 = 1
	In decrement: x = 1
	In main: x2 = 2
	In zeroOutArray: x[0], x[1] = 0, 0
	In main: x3[0], x3[1] = 3, 3
